> **Detail document, not yet reviewed against the 2026-10-29 decisions** (see [../../../docs/04-decisions-log.md](../../../docs/04-decisions-log.md)). Phase labels follow the spec in [../../../docs/01-feature-spec.md](../../../docs/01-feature-spec.md) where they differ.

## 1. Structure

```
Industry  →  Category  →  Subcategory  →  Attribute schema (per category)
```

- Industry and category are **data, not code**. The admin taxonomy builder adds them without a release.
- Each category has: booking modes allowed (instant / scheduled / RFQ / contract), verification requirements, response deadline, cancellation policy, and a custom-field schema.
- Anyone can **suggest** a category; admin approves, merges or rejects.
- Counts shown are the mockup's sample category counts.

## 3. Taxonomy clean-up needed

| Issue | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| "Packaging & printing" (P2) overlaps "Marketing, media & printing" and the "Packaging" subcategory in Wholesale | Merge print/packaging into one industry; keep Wholesale→Packaging as a product view of the same categories |
| "Real estate & property services" (P3) overlaps "Finance, insurance & real estate" (P2) | Keep property services (FM, inspection) separate from property finance/brokerage |
| "Education & training providers" (P2) overlaps "Healthcare, education & wellness" (MVP) | Tutors stay in MVP; corporate training moves under Professional services |
| Security & safety icon id is `i_print` in code | Rename id to `i_security` |
| "Healthcare" mixes regulated care with wellness | Split verification rules per category (regulated licence required for nursing/diagnostics) |

## 4. Offer type by category

| Type | Examples | Booking modes | Typical verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Service** | Home, Events, Professional, IT, Automotive, Health | Instant / Scheduled / RFQ / Contract | ID + address; licence if regulated |
| **Contractor** | Construction | RFQ / Contract (milestones) | GST, contractor licence, insurance |
| **Manufacturer** | Manufacturing, Textiles, Chemicals | RFQ / PO / Contract | Factory registration, ISO/CE/BIS, audit |
| **Supplier / distributor** | Wholesale, Food, Packaging | Catalogue → RFQ → PO | GST, brand authorisation, warehouse proof |

## 5. Attribute schemas (configurable per category)

Field types: short text, number, single choice, multiple choice, yes/no, file upload, date. Each field has flags: **required**, **filterable**, **compare operator** (min/max), **unit**.

## 6. Governance rules

1. A category cannot go live without: at least one booking mode, a verification rule, a response deadline, and a cancellation policy.
2. Changing a schema **versions** it. Existing listings keep the version they were published under until the vendor edits them.
3. Retiring a category hides it from search and blocks new listings; existing bookings are unaffected.
4. Per-country packs (Phase 2) may override attribute labels and verification evidence but not structure.
