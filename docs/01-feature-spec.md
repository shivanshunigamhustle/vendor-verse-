# VendorVerse Feature Specification (master register)

**This file is the single source of truth for what VendorVerse does and in which phase.** Web and mobile are two clients of one product, so every feature below applies to both unless a row says otherwise. The mockups are measured against this file (see [03-mockup-sync-matrix.md](03-mockup-sync-matrix.md)); this file is not measured against the mockups.

Read order: [README](README.md) · this file · [02-phase-scope.md](02-phase-scope.md) · [03-mockup-sync-matrix.md](03-mockup-sync-matrix.md) · [04-decisions-log.md](04-decisions-log.md) · [05-maintenance-runbook.md](05-maintenance-runbook.md)

## How to read this file

**Phases** (decision D-001)

| Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **P1** | Phase 1: launch scope on web, Android and iOS together. Equals the old "MVP", PRS "Release 1" and "Wave 1". |
| **P2** | Phase 2: next release. Screens stay visible in the mockups with a "Phase 2" badge (D-010). |
| **P3** | Phase 3: future roadmap. Direction only; not scheduled. PRS items called "Future" are listed here (see D-014, awaiting confirmation). |
| **OPEN** | Phase not yet decided. The row names the open decision (O-xx in the decisions log). Nothing is built or removed for an OPEN row until it is decided. |

**Rules for this file**

- Every row has exactly one phase. A feature that spans phases is split into two rows (for example F-CON-01 and F-CON-03), so a phase can be read straight off the row.
- IDs are permanent. A removed or deferred feature keeps its row (struck through or with its new phase) and gets a Change Log line. IDs are never reused.
- `PRS ref` points to the Comprehensive PRS v3.0 (24 Oct 2026). Where the owner's decisions differ from the PRS, the decision wins and the difference is listed in [04-decisions-log.md](04-decisions-log.md) section 3.
- Descriptions state the rule, not the screen. Screen names and IDs live only in the sync matrix.
- **Platform:** every feature is on web and mobile (D-013) **except the admin portal (areas ADM, and the admin rows of other areas such as F-AGT-07, F-SUB-07, F-TAX-02), which is web only (D-015).** Admin rows keep their phase; their mobile status in the matrix is N/A.

## Change Log

| Date & time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, local) | Updated by | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-29 17:21 | Shil1517 | Modified: platform rule (admin portal is web only, D-015); F-AGT-06 and F-AGT-07 descriptions | Owner instruction during the web/mobile mockup sync; both apps now show agent commissions. |
| 2026-10-29 16:27 | Shil1517 | Added: master feature register (all rows) | Web and mobile mockups had drifted and the PRS v3 was out of date; one phase-tagged register is needed so both can be synced. Phases per decisions D-001 to D-014. |
