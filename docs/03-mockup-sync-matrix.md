# Mockup Sync Matrix (web ↔ mobile)

Maps every feature in [01-feature-spec.md](01-feature-spec.md) to the screens that implement it on web and on mobile, and says what each mockup must change to match. **This is the work list for the mockup sync.** The web sync pass was done on 2026-10-30 (statuses below); the mobile columns were not changed in that pass.

**Basis of the statuses.** Read from the two screen registries (`web/src/registry.jsx`: 178 screens, `mobile/src/registry.jsx`: 162 screens) and the earlier gap analysis. Web statuses after 2026-10-30 were set from the code and a render check of every registered web screen; nobody clicked through the apps end to end, so treat a status as "what the registry and code show", not as a test result. Screen IDs are the registry IDs.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Done | Screen exists and shows the feature's main rules. Mockup-level only; none of the apps has a backend. |
| Partial | Screen exists but a state, rule or sub-flow is missing, or it differs from the feature spec. |
| Missing | No screen. |
| Hold | Screen exists but the feature's phase or content is undecided (phase OPEN). Do not change it until the open decision is closed. |
| Unverified | Not found in the docs or registry; check the code before syncing. |
| N/A | Nothing to show in this phase. |

**Platform scope.** Both clients carry every P1 feature (D-013). P2 features are shown on both with a "Phase 2" badge (D-010). OPEN rows stay as they are.

**Maintaining this file.** Run `python docs/tools/check_docs.py` after any edit. It fails if a registry screen is unmapped, a screen ID does not exist, or a feature ID is missing from either file. See [05-maintenance-runbook.md](05-maintenance-runbook.md).

## 2. Web screens to retire or fold in

Applied under decision D-009 ("drop web-only admin screens that are not in the PRS"). The screen leaves the web navigation and its useful content moves into the feature named. Nothing is deleted from the code until the sync pass.

| ID | Web screen | Disposition | Folds into | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RET-01 | ad_faqs (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Retire | F-ADM-07 | FAQs management is not in the PRS. |
| RET-02 | ad_requirements (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Retire | F-ADM-06 | Admin browsing of customer requirements is not in the PRS; aggregate demand lives in analytics. |
| RET-03 | ad_supply_gaps (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-ADM-06 | PRS §18 asks for service-coverage gaps as a metric, not a console. |
| RET-04 | ad_quote_moderation (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-TRU-04 | Quote content problems are handled as reports and cases (PRS §12.2). |
| RET-05 | ad_category_templates (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-TAX-03 | Category templates are the per-category RFQ schema (PRS §6.2). |
| RET-06 | ad_rfq_health (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-ADM-06 | RFQ metrics are in PRS §18. |
| RET-07 | ad_platform_settings (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Retire | F-ADM-07 | Duplicate of `ad_settings`. |
| RET-08 | ad_photo_approvals (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-VND-07 | Photos are part of listing review (PRS §12.2). |
| RET-09 | ad_previous (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-VND-07 | Portfolio is vendor content reviewed with the listing (PRS §26.4.2). |
| RET-10 | ad_profile_images (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-VND-07 | Logo and banner are reviewed with the vendor profile. |
| RET-11 | ad_shop_leads (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Fold in | F-AGT-07 | All-leads oversight is part of sales oversight (PRS §4.2). |
| RET-12 | ad_notifications (removed from web 2026-10-30) | Replace | F-MSG-05 | Manual broadcast is not in the PRS; the PRS needs templates and preferences instead (CFG-10). |

## 3. Differences that are not features

These are mockup behaviours that differ between the apps and must be made the same at sync time.

| Topic | Web today | Mobile today | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demo credentials | One OTP (123456) for every role; Super Admin is asked once (since 2026-10-30) | One OTP (123456), admin MFA 654321 | Open: owner asked web to take the OTP once for admin; mobile still has the admin second step. Decide and align. |
| Admin in role picker | Visible | Hidden (`HIDE_ADMIN`) | Open: decide with the mockup sync (see O-11). |
| Persistence | `localStorage` | In memory | Either, but both reset the same way from a "reset demo data" action. |
| Screen counts in READMEs | n/a | Says 93 and 111 | Generated from the registry. |
| Verification wording | n/a | "Tier 1 to 4" | "Level L0 to L4" everywhere. |
| Support wording | Cases (since 2026-10-30; screens renamed c_report, c_cases, c_case, ad_cases, ad_case) | Cases | "Cases". Done on web. |

## Change Log

| Date & time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, local) | Updated by | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-31 10:40 | Shil1517 | Modified: F-BIZ-01, F-BIZ-02 web business-panel logic corrected | Review found: a vendor or the demo business could be switched onto the wrong company, business could open vendor pages and switch to vendor mode (D-005 says a separate account), company chats were one-sided, order list was not scoped to the company. All fixed and browser-verified. Mobile untouched. |
| 2026-10-31 10:37 | Shil1517 | Modified: F-BIZ-01, F-BIZ-02, F-BIZ-04, F-RFQ-01 web Done; Phase 2 badges added for F-GEO-07, F-XCT-02, F-VND-04, F-RFQ-07, F-GDS-07, F-CON-03, F-CON-04, F-TRU-06, F-ADM-11, F-ADM-12 | Owner asked web to follow the docs: Business account rebuilt from the mobile flow (it had near-empty pages), RFQ form rebuilt like mobile, Phase 2 features visibly badged (D-010). Browser-verified J2 to J5 and the business flow. Mobile untouched. |
| 2026-10-30 17:40 | Shil1517 | Modified: F-GEO-01 web location is one shared value | The header location now follows the picker, the profile city, the Explore location filter and the RFQ form defaults, as requested by the owner. |
| 2026-10-30 17:34 | Shil1517 | Modified: F-ACC-01 web admin sign-in asks the OTP once | Owner request 2026-10-30. Differs from mobile (admin second step 654321) and from the spec line on privileged-role extra verification; needs a decision. |
| 2026-10-30 17:31 | Shil1517 | Modified: no status change; web flows verified in a browser run | Walked vendor sign-up, listing approval, booking, RFQ and quote flows in headless Chrome. Vendor onboarding now runs register, OTP, type chooser, verification form (F-VND-01, F-VND-02). Form screens centred; URL hash navigation fixed. |
| 2026-10-30 17:05 | Shil1517 | Modified: F-BIZ-03, F-GEO-01, F-GEO-02, F-SUB-02, F-SUB-05, F-TRU-04, F-AGT-05, F-AGT-06 web statuses | Second web sync pass: geography picker, subscription and moderation depth, company storefront (Phase 2) and the agent Performance tab ported from the mobile flows. Mobile code untouched. |
| 2026-10-30 16:42 | Shil1517 | Modified: web columns and statuses for ~85 features; 12 retired web screens removed from the registry; RET rows marked removed | Web sync pass requested by the owner: add the missing Phase 1 screens, rename to the mobile IDs (c_book_new, c_report, c_cases, c_case, ad_cases, ad_case), apply D-005, D-006, D-007, D-009. Mobile columns untouched. |
| 2026-10-29 16:27 | Shil1517 | Added: sync matrix for all features; 12 retired/folded web screens | Needed a per-feature work list so web and mobile mockups can be synced to one spec. Retirements follow D-009. |
