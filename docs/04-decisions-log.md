# Decisions Log

Every scope decision lives here, with who made it and why. Features reference these IDs (D-xx decided, O-xx open). A decision is never deleted: if it changes, add a new decision that supersedes it and mark the old one `Superseded by D-xx`.

## 1. Decisions made

| ID | Date | Decided by | Decision | Why / effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | Use **Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3** as the only phase scheme. PRS waves and delivery phases are cross-references only. | Three schemes (PRS release/wave/phase, mobile MVP/P2/P3) were in use and disagreed. |
| D-002 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Payments: Phase 1 = Mode A (direct) + Mode B (invoice / offline terms). Phase 2 = Mode C** (checkout, escrow, wallet, refunds, payouts, commission engine). | Matches PRS release scope; removes the conflict between mobile P2 escrow screens and the web "no payments" position. Mode B needs new screens on both (F-PAY-02). |
| D-003 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Purchase orders are in Phase 1**: goods RFQ > accepted quote > PO > tracking. No cart, no inventory checkout, no platform-handled payment. | Needed for the vendor-to-vendor and bulk-supplier demo journeys. Differs from PRS §24 (see section 3). |
| D-004 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Contracts: core in Phase 1** (propose, counter, in-app acceptance, milestones, disputes). **Renewal, amendment, termination and e-sign provider in Phase 2.** | Keeps contracts available for ongoing work without the full legal lifecycle. Suspend/resume and expiry were not named: O-08. |
| D-005 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Business is a separate account type** (mobile model): owner-only, 3+ years and registered, admin-verified. Web adopts it. Team roles are Phase 2. | Web had treated Business as a vendor variant. |
| D-006 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Agent commissions are in Phase 1** on both web and mobile. | Reverses the mobile decision that removed commissions. The PRS does not mention agent pay; the model is open (O-03). |
| D-007 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Subscription plans: names only, no prices** in the docs. Mockups show placeholders labelled sample until CFG-01 and CFG-02 are decided. | Web (Normal / Pro / Premium) and mobile (Free / Starter / Growth / Pro) used different plans and prices; the PRS says not to invent them. |
| D-008 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Phase 1 geography and language:** India launch cities (Jaipur, Ajmer, Sikar, Delhi NCR), English and Hindi. Picker, waitlist and ships-to display stay in Phase 1. Multi-currency, Incoterms, samples, more languages and UAE / Singapore are Phase 2. | Matches mobile scope doc. |
| D-009 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Web-only admin screens that are not in the PRS are dropped.** Their useful content folds into the matching feature. | Listed in the sync matrix section 2 (RET-01 to RET-12). Two screens that need a ruling are held (O-01, O-02). |
| D-010 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Phase 2 features stay visible in both mockups with a "Phase 2" badge.** | Stakeholders see the roadmap; hidden flags made the mockups drift. |
| D-011 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Recurring booking series are in Phase 1.** | PRS §26.5 and the priority review list it as a distinct journey. Neither mockup has it yet. |
| D-012 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Deliverable is a Markdown set in `docs/`.** The PRS .docx is not edited; deviations are listed in section 3. | A diffable format that can be checked by script. |
| D-013 | 2026-10-29 | Shil1517 | **Web and mobile are one product.** Every Phase 1 feature is on both, with the same rules, terms and status names. | Stated by the owner; PRS §17 requires parity. Supersedes the mobile scope doc's "Android and iOS only, web separate". |
| D-014 | 2026-10-29 | Claude (derived from D-001), awaiting Shil1517 | **PRS items marked "Future" map to Phase 3** (cart checkout, enterprise procurement, AI, field tools, advanced ads). | D-001 defines Phase 3 as future roadmap. This is an inference, listed under O-12 for confirmation. |

## 2. Open decisions

Nothing in these rows is built, changed or removed until the decision is closed. When closed, add a D-xx row above, update the feature's phase in [01-feature-spec.md](01-feature-spec.md), and mark the O-xx row `Closed by D-xx`.

| ID | Question | Features affected | Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-01 | Can an admin create a vendor or business supplier on their behalf? | F-ADM-13 | Web has "Add vendor"; PRS §4.2 allows audited admin intervention on listings but does not describe creating accounts. Agents already have consent-based assisted onboarding. |
| O-02 | Are coupons in scope? | F-SUB-04 | Not in the PRS. Present in the web admin and in mobile plan checkout. D-009 would drop them, but that also removes the coupon field from the Phase 1 checkout. |
| O-03 | How are agent commissions calculated, who pays, and how are they paid out? | F-AGT-06, F-AGT-07 | D-006 puts commission in Phase 1; web shows amounts, mobile has nothing. The PRS has no agent-pay model. Agent commission is separate from the Phase 2 platform commission engine. |
| O-04 | Are country packs Phase 1 or Phase 2? | F-GEO-04 | The mobile scope doc lists country packs under both. Only India is live in Phase 1. |
| O-05 | Are dual approval and the market activation checklist in Phase 1? | F-GEO-05, F-ADM-09 | PRS requires dual approval for market activation and commission changes. Neither mockup implements it. Phase 1 launch cities need an activation step. |
| O-06 | What does a purchase order's "payment failed" state mean when the platform handles no payments? | F-GDS-05 | The mobile mockup has it; in Phase 1 the platform cannot fail a payment. Options: remove, or redefine as "supplier did not confirm payment terms". |
| O-07 | Can customers order directly from a company storefront, or do vendors only message companies? | F-BIZ-03 | Mobile scope doc says message only. The mobile mockup has a company directory, storefront and an "Order from a company" flow with company-side order handling. |
| O-08 | Are contract suspend/resume and expiry in Phase 1 or Phase 2? | F-CON-05 | D-004 named the other lifecycle parts but not these. |
| O-09 | Phase for PRS-required items that neither mockup has and no document placed: profile completeness, field visibility classes, saved searches and alerts, web SEO landing pages, chat attachments / scanning / read receipts, automated content screening. | F-VND-11, F-VND-12, F-DSC-08, F-DSC-09, F-MSG-03, F-TRU-07 | Each is a PRS "must" for the release wave in which it is enabled. |
| O-10 | Do manufacturers launch under the Wholesale industry in Phase 1 while "Manufacturing and OEM" opens in Phase 2? | F-TAX-05, F-TAX-06 | Open item from the mobile scope doc (decision 7). |
| O-11 | Is the admin role visible in the mockup role picker on both apps? | sync matrix section 3 | Web shows it; mobile hides it (`HIDE_ADMIN`). Needed so both demo the same journeys. |
| O-12 | Confirm D-014 (PRS "Future" = Phase 3) and whether the PRS should be reissued as v3.1. | F-GDS-08, F-GDS-09, F-DSC-10 and others | The PRS is dated 24 Oct 2026 and is out of step with decisions D-003, D-005, D-006, D-011, D-013. |

## 3. Where these decisions differ from the PRS v3.0

The PRS is not edited (D-012). Until it is reissued, the decision wins.

| PRS says | Decision | PRS ref |
|---|---|---|
| Product orders are Future; no cart or checkout in Release 1. | Purchase orders are in Phase 1 (cart and checkout still are not). D-003 | §2, §24 |
| Four roles; vendor staff and team accounts are Future. | Business is a separate account type in Phase 1 (still owner-only; no staff roles). D-005 | §3, §4, §26.4.1 |
| Sales Agent: leads, onboarding, conversion tracking, assigned performance. Nothing about agent pay. | Agent commissions in Phase 1. D-006 | §3, §26.8 |
| Contracts are enabled per category in Wave 1 with the full lifecycle (§26.5.1). | Core in Phase 1; renewal, amendment, termination in Phase 2. D-004 | §26.5.1 |
| Instant, scheduled, RFQ and contract bookings; scheduled includes recurring series. | Agrees; recurring is explicitly Phase 1. D-011 | §26.5 |
| Plan names and prices are open configuration. | Agrees; mockups show names with sample values only. D-007 | §11.1, CFG-01 |
| "Web, Android and iOS are intended to launch together." | Agrees. Supersedes the mobile scope doc's "mobile only". D-013 | §2.1 |
| Initial launch in selected cities, English and Hindi. | Agrees; India launch cities fixed. D-008 | §2.1, CFG-13 |

## 4. Conflicts from the earlier web-vs-mobile gap analysis, and their resolution

| Gap-analysis item | Resolution |
|---|---|
| #1 Which requirements version is the source? | PRS v3.0 plus these docs (decisions win over PRS text). |
| #29 Payment model disagreement | D-002. |
| #43 Agent commissions contradiction | D-006 (commission in Phase 1); model open O-03. |
| #35 Plan names and prices | D-007. |
| #8 Business: separate account or vendor variant | D-005. |
| #11 Which admin consoles belong on both sides | D-009 for web-only screens; mobile-only admin screens (cases, subscriptions, geo, taxonomy, config register, company queue, reviews) are Phase 1 features on both (sync matrix). |
| #3 Mobile meta screens vs web scope-review screen | F-MCK-01: both mockups provide the same review screens. |
