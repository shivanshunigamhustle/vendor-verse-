# Phase Scope: Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3

The phase of every feature is set in one place: the `Phase` column of [01-feature-spec.md](01-feature-spec.md). This file explains the boundaries and shows each phase as a list. **The lists in section 3 are generated from the spec; do not edit them by hand.** Run `python docs/tools/check_docs.py --write` after changing the spec.

## 1. What each phase means

| Phase | Scope | Old names it replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Launch scope on web, Android and iOS together. India launch cities (Jaipur, Ajmer, Sikar, Delhi NCR), English and Hindi. Customers pay vendors directly (Mode A), or by invoice / offline terms for contracts (Mode B). Platform revenue is vendor subscriptions and sponsored visibility. | "MVP", PRS "Release 1", PRS "Wave 1" |
| Phase 2 | Platform-facilitated payments and commission, more countries and languages, cross-border trade, team roles, L4 verification, contract renewal and amendment. | Mobile "Phase 2", PRS "Wave 2/3" where decided |
| Phase 3 | Direction only: AI, enterprise procurement, cart checkout, more regions, remaining industries. | Mobile "Phase 3", PRS "Future" (see D-014) |
| OPEN | Not decided. Not built, not removed. | none |

## 2. Where one capability spans phases

Where the same capability starts in Phase 1 and grows in Phase 2, it is split into two features so each has one phase.

|---|---|---|
| Payments | Mode A direct payment record and Mode B invoice / offline-terms records (F-PAY-01, F-PAY-02) | Checkout and escrow, wallet, refunds, payouts, commission engine, foreign-currency checkout, payout tax (F-PAY-03 to F-PAY-09) |

| Geography | India launch cities and the picker, waitlist, rollout manager (F-GEO-01 to F-GEO-03, F-GEO-06) | More countries and metros; multi-currency display (F-GEO-07, F-GEO-08) |

## 4. How Phase 2 and Phase 3 appear in the mockups

- **Phase 2:** the screen exists on both web and mobile, reachable from normal navigation, with a visible "Phase 2" badge (D-010). A Phase 2 screen must not change what a Phase 1 flow does. For example, a Phase 1 booking never routes through checkout.
- **Phase 3:** appears only in the roadmap / vision screen and in these docs.
- **OPEN:** the screen, if it exists, is left unchanged and is not badged until the decision is closed.

## 5. Mapping to the PRS waves

| This doc | PRS v3 |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Release 1 and Wave 1; delivery phases 0 to 6 |
| Phase 2 | Waves 2 and 3 for the items decided here. Payment Mode C stays gated by CFG-15 and CFG-16 and legal review. |
| Phase 3 | Chapter 24 deferred roadmap |

Where this file and the PRS disagree, this file wins and the difference is recorded in [04-decisions-log.md](04-decisions-log.md) section 3.

## Change Log

| Date & time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, local) | Updated by | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-30 11:34 | Shil1517 | Modified: restored docs, web/src and mobile/src to commit 06ab837 | Owner did not want web and mobile UIs matched; reverted the sync work and its doc changes. |
| 2026-10-29 16:27 | Shil1517 | Added: phase definitions, split-capability table, generated phase lists | The old docs gave the phase split in three places that disagreed; one view per phase now comes from the spec. |
